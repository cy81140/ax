# Project Plan: Single-Community Amino App Clone

## 1. Project Overview

*   **Goal**: Develop a simplified version of the Amino app, focusing on a single shared community where users can engage, share content, and communicate. The chatrooms will be organized by regions and provinces in the Philippines.
*   **Target Audience**: Users interested in connecting with others based on their region and province in the Philippines.
*   **Design**: Maintain a clean, intuitive interface similar to Amino's look and feel, with a focus on easy navigation between regions and provinces. Prioritize the main feed and chatroom UI.

## 4. Development Process

*   **Phase 1: Project Setup and User Authentication**
    1.  **Set up Supabase**:
        *   Create a Supabase project and configure the database schema.
        *   Enable Supabase Auth for email/password and social logins.
    2.  **Integrate Supabase SDK in React Native**:
        *   Install `@supabase/supabase-js` and initialize it in your app.
    3.  **Implement Authentication Features**:
        *   Registration, login, and profile management.
*   **Phase 2: Content Creation and Sharing**
    1.  **Database Schema Design**:
        *   Define tables for `users`, `posts`, `comments`, and `polls`.
        *   Add relationships (e.g., a user has many posts, and a post has many comments).
    2.  **Implement Content Features**:
        *   Allow users to create text posts, upload images/videos, and create polls/quizzes.
        *   Use Supabase Storage for media uploads.
*   **Phase 3: Direct Messaging and Chatrooms**
    1.  **Database Schema**:
        *   Update the `group_chats` table to represent provinces.
        *   Add a `region_id` column to the `group_chats` table to represent the region.
        *   Pre-populate the `group_chats` table with the regions and provinces of the Philippines.
        *   The `messages` table will still be used for storing messages within each province (chatroom).
    2.  **Real-time Messaging**:
        *   Use Supabase Realtime to enable live updates for messages within each province (chatroom).
        *   Implement typing indicators using Supabase Realtime.
        *   Implement read receipts by updating a `read_at` column in the `messages` table.
    3.  **Push Notifications**:
        *   Integrate Expo Push Notifications or FCM for message notifications.
        *   Send push notifications when a user receives a new message in a province (chatroom) they are a member of.
*   **Phase 4: Search and Activity Feeds**
    1.  **Search Functionality**:
        *   Use Supabase's full-text search (`pg_search`) for searching users and posts.
        *   Implement message search within chatrooms.
    2.  **Activity Feed**:
        *   Use Supabase Realtime to listen for changes in the `posts` and `comments` tables.
        *   Display recent activities in a feed.
*   **Phase 5: Moderation System and Testing**
    1.  **Reporting Tools**:
        *   Create a `reports` table to track flagged content.
        *   Build an admin panel to review and manage reports.
        *   Implement user muting/unmuting functionality.
        *   Implement admin actions: Banning users and deleting posts.
    2.  **Testing**:
        *   Test all features thoroughly, focusing on edge cases (e.g., large file uploads, poor network conditions).
*   **Phase 6: Deployment**
    1.  **Deploy to App Stores**:
        *   Use Expo's EAS Build to generate production builds for iOS and Android.
        *   Publish the app to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
    2.  **Post-Deployment Monitoring**:
        *   Use tools like Sentry or Datadog to monitor app performance and errors.

## 15. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### Scalability
- **Risk:** High traffic may strain the backend.
- **Mitigation:** Use Supabase's scalable infrastructure and optimize database queries.

### Security
- **Risk:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Mitigation:** Implement Row-Level Security (RLS) in Supabase and encrypt sensitive data.

### Performance
- **Risk:** Slow load times for media-heavy content.
- **Mitigation:** Use a CDN for image/video delivery and lazy-load content.

### Cross-platform Compatibility
- **Risk:** UI inconsistencies between iOS and Android.
- **Mitigation:** Thoroughly test on both platforms and use responsive design principles.

## 16. Key Differences from Multi-Community App

1. **Simplified Database Schema:**
   - No need for separate `communities` or `categories` tables.
   - All posts, comments, and activities belong to the single community.

2. **Streamlined Moderation:**
   - Moderation tools are focused on managing content and users.
   - Admin roles and permissions are simpler since there's no hierarchy of communities.

3. **Reduced Complexity in Navigation:**
   - The app's UI can focus on core features without needing a community selection screen or category filters.

## 17. Advantages of a Single-Community App

1. **Faster Development:**
   - Fewer features to implement, reducing development time.
2. **Easier Moderation:**
   - Centralized moderation makes it easier to manage content and users.
3. **Stronger Community Focus:**
   - A single shared space fosters deeper engagement and interaction among users.

## 18. Potential Challenges

1. **Scalability:**
   - As the user base grows, ensure the app can handle high traffic and large volumes of posts/messages.
2. **User Retention:**
   - Without multiple communities, users may lose interest over time. Consider gamification or rewards to keep them engaged.
